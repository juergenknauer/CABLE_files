This readme documents how to do a full CABLE-CASA-POP-LUC run with BIOS met and parameter forcing. bash scripts are in the 'scripts' directory

The code branch is:
  https://trac.nci.org.au/svn/cable/branches/Share/NESP2pt9_BLAZE/

The executable is generated from
  https://trac.nci.org.au/svn/cable/branches/Share/NESP2pt9_BLAZE/offline/build.ksh
or ./build_mpi.ksh for mpi code.

This executable should be copied or linked to the 'exes' directory.

The met, LUH2, forcing and mask were created by extracting the gridcell for Harvard Forest from the global data sets using the script extract_met.bash

The run steps are follows

Steps 1-5 are done with fixed CO2, N deposition with repeated meteorology (BIOS.nml), LU of 1700 (LUC.nml).

1. run_cable_init_0.bash
This is the first phase of spinup. It runs the full model, with static (eg 1700, set by YearStart in LUC.nml) land-use, and with biomass stocks initialised to zero. This run has a 'cold start', i.e. climate_from_zero, POP_from_zero and casa_from_zero are all set to 'True', and no restart files are required. 'limit_labile' flag set to .TRUE.. This flag turs resets the labile P and mineral N pools to high values to prvent nutrient limitation, allowing biomass stocks to approach equilibrium faster.
In cable.nml:
   cable_user%CLIMATE_fromZero = .T.
   cable_user%POP_fromZero     = .T.
   cable_user%CASA_fromZero    = .T.
   cable_user%POPLUC           = .T.
   cable_user%POPLUC_RunType   = 'static'
   cable_user%limit_labile     = .T.
   icycle                      = 3 (2 for CN or 3 for CNP)

3. run_cable_spinup_limit_labile.bash
Same as above, but this time casa, climate and POP are initialised from restart files.
In cable.nml:
   cable_user%CLIMATE_fromZero = .F.
   cable_user%POP_fromZero     = .F.
   cable_user%CASA_fromZero    = .F.
   cable_user%POPLUC           = .T.
   cable_user%POPLUC_RunType   = 'static'
   cable_user%limit_labile     = .T.
   icycle                      = 3
   cable_user%CASA_DUMP_READ   = .F.
   cable_user%CASA_DUMP_WRITE  = .T.

4. run_cable_spin_casa_limit_labile.bash
This uses dump files from step(3) to run casa in isolation from the cable biophysics. Soil and litter pools are brought to quasi-equilibrium using an analytic steady-state solution. Further iterations of casa-POP are performed to bring the biomass closer to equilibrium.
In cable.nml:
   cable_user%CLIMATE_fromZero = .F.
   cable_user%POP_fromZero     = .F.
   cable_user%CASA_fromZero    = .F.
   cable_user%POPLUC           = .T.
   cable_user%POPLUC_RunType   = 'static'
   cable_user%limit_labile     = .T.
   spincasa                    = .T. ! .t. only for analytic spin cycle
   icycle                      = 12
   cable_user%CASA_DUMP_READ   = .T.
   cable_user%CASA_DUMP_WRITE  = .F.

5. Repeat pairs of run_cable_spinup_limit_labile.bash and run_cable_spin_casa_limit_labile.bash (steps 3 and 4, several times).

6. Repeated sequence of run_cable_spinup.bash and run_cable_spin_casa.bash (same as 3-5 above, but this time labile P and mineral N pools  are not restricted).
In cable.nml:
   cable_user%limit_labile = .F.

7. Full cable run from 1860 to 1899: run_cable_1860_1899.bash
Uses recycled met, but dynamic Ndep and CO2

8. Full cable run from 1900 to 1989: run_cable_1900_1989.bash
Actual met this time

9. Full cable run from 1990 to 2017: run_cable_1990_2017.bash
Actual met this time

10. To re-estimate stocks after changes to biogeochemical params:
run_cable_spin_casa.bash
run_casa_only_1860_1989.bash
run_casa_only_1990_2017.bash

These runs run casa only,  using dump files in current run directory. To specify alternate dump file location, be sure to set casafile%c2cdumppath accordingly.





For mpi run:
replace
./cable >& $logfile
by
mpirun -np 28 ./cable-mpi >& $logfile



# Steps to do
mkdir run_20190502
cd run_20190502
ln -s {full path to CABLE executable}
ln -s {full path to CABLE-AUX 
ln -s ../driver_files
mkdir outputs restart logs

change domain name in all bios.nml templates in the dirver files dir:
cd driver_files
templatename=CasaObs
domname=howard_springs
sed -i "s/${templatename}/${domname}/g" bios.nml*
(NB you need double quotes above to make the shell expand the variables)

for mpi run, in all bash scripts:

sed -i 's?./cable ?#./cable?g' *.bash

sed -i 's?#mpirun -np 20?mpirun -np 20?g' *.bash

to comment out entries in bios.nml files that are not used in NESP2pt9 branch:
sed -i 's/vegtypeigbp_file/!vegtypeigbp_file/g' bios.nml*
sed -i 's/avgannmax_fapar_file/!avgannmax_fapar_file/g' bios.nml*


to switch between soil C turnover params

sed -i "s/cable_user%SMRF_NAME = 'DAMM'/cable_user%SMRF_NAME = 'Trudinger2016'/g" cable.nml*
sed -i "s/cable_user%STRF_NAME = 'DAMM'/cable_user%STRF_NAME = 'Q10'/g" cable.nml*


To update to 2018 met
sed -i 's/1900010120171231/1900010120181231/g' bios.nml*
sed -i 's/b1807/b1904/g' bios.nml*
sed -i 's/b1801/b1904/g' bios.nml*
sed -i 's/1750_2017/1750_2018/g' bios.nml*
